# Graph Editor Tool

A comprehensive graph editing application built with wxPython that supports creating, editing, and managing graphs with nodes and edges.

## Features

- **Graph Management**: Create, load, save, import, copy, and delete graphs
- **DOT Format Support**: Full import/export compatibility with Graphviz DOT format
- **Cluster/Container System**: Hierarchical node organization with expand/collapse functionality
- **Node and Edge Editing**: Add, delete, copy, and modify graph elements
- **Advanced Edge Types**: Straight, curved, BÃ©zier, B-spline, NURBS, polyline, and composite curves
- **Selection Tools**: Select nodes, edges, or everything including convex shape selection
- **3D Positioning**: Set x, y, z coordinates for nodes and edges
- **Infinite Zoom**: Zoom in and out of the canvas infinitely
- **Layout Algorithms**: Apply various layout algorithms to organize graphs
- **Metadata Support**: Add and modify metadata for graphs, nodes, and edges
- **Drag and Drop**: Move elements around the canvas with smart snapping
